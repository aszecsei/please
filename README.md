# please

> A polite task runner

## Background

Tasks automation is always useful, but tooling isn't always there. `please` is a cross-platform tool that doesn't have any external dependencies. Automation is written in a sane language, with enough features to automate whatever you want, however you want.

## Installation

## Scripting

`please` has a structure inspired by `make`.

### Recipes

A recipe is defined by:

```please
name:
    COMMANDS
```

Recipes may not be nested.
